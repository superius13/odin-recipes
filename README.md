This is my first project on The Odin Project.
I've created my first "website"!
On the site you can see some recipes. There is a list of three recipes on the main page. You can go to certain recipe by clicking on it's name!
I have just started my way into web-development and I'm so exited. I'm looking forward to next projects! So, good luck to you if you're still reading this. Bye.
