    <h2 class="small-heading">Description</h2>
    <p>The secret to this blueberry pie is using quick-cooking tapioca in the blueberry filling instead of flour or cornstarch. You can use frozen blueberries, as long as you thaw them and drain the excess liquid, and a store-bought pie crust if you prefer.</p>
    <h2 class="small-heading">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ¼ cups white sugar</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons quick-cooking tapioca </li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon </li>
      <li>3 cups blueberries </li>
      <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice </li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter </li>
      <li>1 pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="small-heading">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Roll out half the pastry and line a 9-inch pie pan; trim crust to the rim of the pan. Loosely cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.</li>
      <li>Combine sugar, tapioca, and cinnamon. Toss sugar mixture with blueberries in a mixing bowl and sprinkle with lemon juice. Let stand fifteen minutes. Meanwhile, roll out the top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into half-inch strips. Pour blueberry mixture into chilled pie shell and dot with butter. Add the pastry strips one at a time, weaving a lattice. Flute edges.</li>
      <li>Place pie on a baking sheet to catch drips. Bake in the preheated oven for 40 to 50 minutes, until filling is bubbly and crust is light brown. Cool completely before serving.</li>
    </ol>
